# kale.js

The node.js framework for developers who deliver.

## What is it?

## Installation

```
npm install -g kalejs
```

## Usage

To start a new project, simply run `kale new <project_name>`, for example:

```
kale new example-app

This will build a new kale.js app in `./example-app`.

From the root of the new project, run `./bin/setup`, then `npm start` and you'll have a server running.
